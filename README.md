# exact_Compton
These routines compute the exact redistribution function due to Compton scattering

Included is a driving program (driveSRF.f) which calls all pertinent routines.

The main output of the code is what we calle the "super redistribution function
(SRF)" for Compton scatterting. For a given gas temperature T and final photon
energy Ef, the SRF is defined for a set of initial photon energies Ei as:

         SRF(T,Ef,Ei) = IRF(Ef,Ei)/N(Ei)*skn(Ei)*dEi/Ei
     
where IRF(Ef,Ei) is in fact the inverse redistribution function for the Compton
scattering of a photon from initial energy Ei to final energy Ef; N(Ei) is the
normalization to ensure photon number conservation; and skn(Ei) is the
Klein-Nishina cross section.  This routine implements the exact Compton RF from
Madej et al. (2017).  The SRF contains all the information needed for the
convolution of a given spectrum to account for the Compton scattering at the
given temperature.  Only significant values of the SRF are actually written,
i.e., when RF > limit.

When angles are introducted, the code calculates

         SRF(T,uf,ui) = IRF(uf,ui)/N(ui)*skn(Ei)*dEi/Ei

where ui = (Ei, MUi) represents an initial energy-angle pairing, and likewise
uf = (Ef, MUf) represents a final energy-angle pairing.  As the RF is dependent
on scatting angle only, it is integrated over knsamps number of azimuthal angle
points.

The output of this code is used by the XILLVER model.

## Input file structure
Five parameters can be read in by the program by creating the file <I>drive_params.dat</I>.  The parameters are:
* nmaxp (number of energy points in the grid)
* itrans (number of temperatures in the grid)
* mgi (number of angles to evaluate at, for the angular averaged SRF.  If <=0, the angular averaged SRF is returned.)
* limit (the fractional limit of the maximum value of the SRF, below which it's assumed to be 0.)
* knsamps (the number of angular points to integrate the SRF over)

The file should be formatted as so (these are the default parameters within the code)


      nmaxp 500
      itrans 70
      mgi 3000
      limit 0.001
      knsamps 0
## Output file structure
The fits file produced contains five HDUs.  It will be called <I>angles.fits</I> for the angular resolved code, else <I>table.fits</I> for the angular integrated code.
### 1.  Primary HDU
This doesn't contain any infomation, and exists simply for the datastructure of the fits file.
### 2.  Parameters
This contains three or five columns, and one row.  The last two columns only exist when the code produces an angular resolved SRF.
1. TEMP (K) - array of temperature points used.
2. ENERGIES (eV) - array energy points used.
3. del ENERGY (eV) - array energy widths used.
4. MU - The cos(angle) > 0 gridpoints used
5. WEIGHTS - the weights to be used with the angular points in gauss legendre quadrature

### 3.  KN_cross
One column, with one row.  This contains the Kleinâ€“Nishina cross-section for every photon energy and electron temperature.

Each element in the array corresponds to a temperature/energy grid pair.  For N energy points, and T temperature points, the first N elements correspond to the first temperature grid point; the elements (N+1)...(2N) correspond to the second temperature point, and so on.
### 4.  SRF_Pointers
This contains two columns:
1. IND - the starting indices of the energy/angle array which the first value of the saved iSRF array corresponds to.
Each element here is an array, containing values for each row of the iSRF.
2. LEN - the length of the saved iSRF array. Each element here is an array, containing values for each row of the iSRF.

In the angular resolved version, there are two rows, each relating to Re and Ro respectively.
### 5.  iSRF
Each row corresponds to a final energy & angle & temperature pair, in an analogous way as the elements of the KN cross-section (table 3).  The fastest changing value is the angle, followed by energy, followed by temperature.

For the angular resolved version, there are two columns, relating to the symmetric and anti-symmetric components of the SRF. See Milkey, Shine, and Mihalas (1975) for details (look between eqs. 24 and 27).

Each element in each column is a variable length array, having trimmed out all the elements below the cut-off limit.  Each element in this array also corresponds to (energy, angle) pairs, with the angle varying first.
Use the IND and LEN columns from table 4 to reconstruct the full iSRF.
## File versions
This software produces SRF files of version '2.0' (angle averaged format) and version '3.0' (angle resolved format), designed to be used with XILLVER v3.4e onwards.
